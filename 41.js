let x = [1, 2, 3]; 
  
console.log(typeof x); 

/* The code snippet defines an array `x` containing the elements `[1, 2, 3]`.

When you use the `typeof` operator on `x`, it returns the data type of `x`. In this case, `x` is indeed an array.

Therefore, `console.log(typeof x);` will output `'object'`, indicating that `x` is of type object. */
