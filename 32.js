let x = []; 
console.log(Boolean(x)); 



/*


In JavaScript, when you use Boolean() function to convert a value to a boolean, it follows certain rules to determine the resulting boolean value:

If the value is falsy (such as false, 0, "", null, undefined, or NaN), the resulting boolean value will be false.
If the value is truthy (any value that is not falsy), the resulting boolean value will be true.
In the case of an empty array [], it is a truthy value because it is not one of the falsy values listed above. Therefore, when you use Boolean(x) where x is an empty array, it will result in true.

So, console.log(Boolean(x)); will output true.
