setTimeout(() => { 
    console.log(1); 
    }, 0); 
    
    console.log(2); 


    /*     
    
    In this code snippet, you have a `setTimeout` function call with a callback that logs `1` after 0 milliseconds, and then outside of the `setTimeout`, you have a `console.log(2)` statement.

Despite the `setTimeout` being set to 0 milliseconds, it doesn't mean that the callback will be executed immediately. Instead, it will be executed asynchronously after the current synchronous code has finished executing and the JavaScript runtime is free.

So, when you run this code, the output will be:

```
2
1
```

First, `2` will be logged to the console immediately, as it's part of the synchronous code. Then, after the synchronous code has finished executing, the callback inside `setTimeout` will be executed, logging `1` to the console.
