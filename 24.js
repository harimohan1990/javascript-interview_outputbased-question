let x = { b: 2, c: 3 }; 
let y = Object.keys(x); 
console.log(y.length); 


/*        
The code you provided initializes an object x with properties b and c, each assigned a value. Then it creates a variable y which holds an array of the keys of the object x using Object.keys(x). Finally, it logs the length of the array y to the console.

Since x has two properties (b and c), Object.keys(x) returns an array with two elements: ['b', 'c']. Therefore, when you log y.length, it will output 2, indicating the number of keys in the object x.
