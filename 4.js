let x = [10, 20, 30, 40]; 
let [a, ...b] = x.reverse(); 
  
console.log(b); 



/*Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `let x = [10, 20, 30, 40];` creates an array `x` with elements `[10, 20, 30, 40]`.
2. `x.reverse()` reverses the elements of the array `x` in place, so after this operation, `x` becomes `[40, 30, 20, 10]`.
3. `let [a, ...b] = x.reverse();` destructures the reversed array `x` into variables `a` and `b`. `a` will be assigned the first element of the reversed array, and `b` will be assigned the rest of the elements as an array.
4. `console.log(b);` prints the value of variable `b`.

Now, let's see the output:

Since `a` is assigned the first element of the reversed array, which is `40`, and `b` is assigned the rest of the elements, `[30, 20, 10]`, the output of `console.log(b);` will be `[30, 20, 10]`. */
