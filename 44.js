let x = [1, 2, 3]; 
let [, , y] = x; 
  
console.log(y); 


/*   

In the provided code:

1. `let x = [1, 2, 3];` initializes an array `x` with three elements `[1, 2, 3]`.
2. `let [, , y] = x;` utilizes array destructuring to extract values from the array `x`. In this case, the first two elements of the array are ignored due to the use of commas `,`, and the third element is assigned to the variable `y`.
3. `console.log(y);` prints the value of `y` to the console.

Since the first two elements of the array `x` are being ignored, the value of the third element (which is `3`) is assigned to the variable `y`.

Therefore, `console.log(y);` will output `3`.
