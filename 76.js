"10"+20+30

/*
In JavaScript, when you use the `+` operator with strings and numbers, it leads to string concatenation once a string is encountered in the expression. Here's how the expression `"10"+20+30` is evaluated:

1. **`"10" + 20`** - The number `20` is converted to a string and concatenated with `"10"`, resulting in the string `"1020"`.
2. **`"1020" + 30`** - Similarly, the number `30` is converted to a string and concatenated with `"1020"`, leading to the string `"102030"`.

Thus, the expression `"10"+20+30` will evaluate to the string `"102030"`.
