/*            

The code snippet you provided showcases the use of JavaScript's `map` and `reduce` array methods to manipulate and calculate values based on an array of numbers. Let's break down each part:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];` - This line initializes an array `numbers` containing the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

2. **Map Function**:
   - `numbers = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);` - The `map` function creates a new array by applying a specified function to each element of the original array. In this case, it doubles each number. After this operation, the `numbers` array will be transformed to `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`.

3. **Reduce Function**:
   - `console.log(numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num));` - The `reduce` method reduces the array to a single value. It takes a reducer function and an optional initial value. The reducer function is applied to each array element in order to accumulate a single return value. Here, the reducer function adds each number to a running total. Starting with an initial value (implicitly `0` if not specified), it processes each element of `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`:
       - **First Iteration**: total = 0, num = 2 → total becomes 2
       - **Second Iteration**: total = 2, num = 4 → total becomes 6
       - **Third Iteration**: total = 6, num = 6 → total becomes 12
       - **Fourth Iteration**: total = 12, num = 8 → total becomes 20
       - **Fifth Iteration**: total = 20, num = 10 → total becomes 30

After all iterations, the total accumulated value is 30, which is then printed to the console.

Hence, the output of this code will be:
```
30
```

This represents the sum of all elements in the transformed array `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`.
