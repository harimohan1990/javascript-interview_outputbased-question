let x = [31, 2, 8]; 
x.sort(); 

console.log(x); 


/*   
When you call the `sort()` method on an array in JavaScript without passing a comparison function, it sorts the array elements as strings based on their Unicode code points. This behavior may lead to unexpected results when sorting arrays of numbers.

Let's break down the code:

1. `let x = [31, 2, 8];` creates an array `x` with elements `[31, 2, 8]`.
2. `x.sort();` sorts the elements of the array `x`. Since no comparison function is provided, it sorts the elements as strings.
3. `console.log(x);` prints the sorted array `x`.

Now, let's see the output:

The sorted array will be `["2", "31", "8"]`. This is because, when sorted as strings, `"2"` comes before `"31"` and `"8"` comes after both. This is not the numerical order we expect.

If you want to sort the array numerically, you should provide a comparison function to `sort()`, like this:

```javascript
let x = [31, 2, 8];
x.sort((a, b) => a - b); // Compare numbers numerically
console.log(x); // Output: [2, 8, 31]
```

This will sort the array `x` numerically, resulting in `[2, 8, 31]`.
