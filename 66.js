const arr1 = [1,2,3];
const arr2 = [1,2,3];
const str = "1,2,3";

console.log(arr1 == str);
console.log(arr1 == arr2);


/*   

In the JavaScript code you provided, there are two `console.log` statements comparing arrays and a string. Hereâ€™s the behavior and output for each comparison:

1. `console.log(arr1 == str);`
   - This statement compares the array `arr1` to the string `str`. When comparing an array to a string in JavaScript, the array is converted to a string by joining all its elements with commas. For `arr1`, this results in the string `"1,2,3"`, which is exactly the content of `str`.
   - **Output:** `true`

2. `console.log(arr1 == arr2);`
   - This statement compares two arrays, `arr1` and `arr2`. In JavaScript, arrays are reference types, which means they are considered equal only if they refer to the exact same object. Even though `arr1` and `arr2` contain the same numbers, they are different instances, so the comparison is false.
   - **Output:** `false`

Thus, the output of your code will be:
```
true
false
```
