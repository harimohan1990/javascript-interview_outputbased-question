console.log([] + []);


/* 
In JavaScript, when you use the `+` operator with arrays, JavaScript attempts to convert each array into a string and then concatenates those strings. If the arrays are empty, they convert to empty strings.

Here's how the expression `[] + []` is evaluated:
- Each empty array (`[]`) is converted to an empty string (`""`).
- Concatenating two empty strings results in another empty string.

Therefore, `console.log([] + []);` outputs an empty string:
```
""
```
