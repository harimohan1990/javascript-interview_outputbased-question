let x = 1 > 2 > 3; 
console.log(x); 


/* 

In JavaScript, the expression `1 > 2 > 3` might seem straightforward, but it actually involves a concept called chaining comparison operators.

Let's break down what's happening here:

1. `1 > 2` evaluates to `false` because `1` is not greater than `2`.
2. Now, you have `false > 3`. In JavaScript, when you use the `>` operator with a boolean value and a number, the boolean value is coerced into a number. `false` is coerced to `0` and `true` is coerced to `1`. So, you're essentially comparing `0 > 3`.
3. `0 > 3` evaluates to `false`.

Therefore, the value of `x` will be `false`. When you log `x` to the console, it will output `false`.
