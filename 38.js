/*     


In JavaScript, the `++` operator is the increment operator. When used before a variable, like `++x`, it increments the value of the variable by 1 and returns the incremented value.

However, there's a difference in behavior when using `++` with a numeric variable and a string variable.

Let's break down the code

1. `x` is a numeric variable initialized with the value `1`.
   - `++x` increments `x` by 1, so `x` becomes `2`. The value of `++x` is `2`.
2. `y` is a string variable initialized with the value `"1"`.
   - When you use the `++` operator with a string, JavaScript will attempt to convert the string to a number before incrementing it. Since `"1"` can be converted to a number, it will be converted to `1`, then incremented by 1. So, `++y` results in `2`.

Therefore, the output of `console.log(++x, ++y);` will be `2 2`. Both `x` and `y` will be incremented by 1, and their values will be printed to the console.
