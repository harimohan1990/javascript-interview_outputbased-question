let x = "false"; 
let y = !x; 

console.log(y); 


/* 
In JavaScript, the `!` operator is the logical NOT operator. It converts the operand to a boolean value and then negates it. 

Let's break down the expression `!x`:

1. `x` is `"false"`.
2. When you apply the `!` operator, it first converts `x` to a boolean value. In JavaScript, any non-empty string (except for the string `"false"`) is considered truthy when converted to a boolean.
3. Since `x` is `"false"`, it's a non-empty string and thus truthy.
4. Applying the logical NOT (`!`) operator negates this truthy value, resulting in `false`.

So, `y` will be `false`. When you log `y` to the console, it will output `false`.
