var z = 1, y = z = typeof y;
console.log(y);


/*
In the JavaScript code snippet you've shared, the sequence of operations and assignments is crucial for understanding the final value of `y`. Let's analyze the statement:

```javascript
var z = 1, y = z = typeof y;
```

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of what occurs:

1. **`var z = 1`** - The variable `z` is initialized with the value `1`.

2. **`y = z = typeof y;`** - This statement involves multiple assignments and the usage of the `typeof` operator, evaluated right-to-left:
   - The `typeof y` is evaluated first. At this point, `y` is declared due to JavaScript's hoisting but has not yet been assigned a value, so it's `undefined`.
   - The result of `typeof y` is `"undefined"` (a string indicating the type of the value `y` holds at the moment of evaluation).
   - This result, `"undefined"`, is then assigned to `z`.
   - Finally, `"undefined"` is also assigned to `y`.

So, by the end of this sequence, both `z` and `y` hold the value `"undefined"`.

When you output `y` with `console.log(y)`, the result is:
```
undefined
```

This output is the string `"undefined"`, representing the type of the initial state of `y` before any value was assigned to it.
