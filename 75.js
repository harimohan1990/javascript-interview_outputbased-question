let x = 5;
let y = ++x;
console.log(y);
console.log(x)


/*    
In your JavaScript code, the use of the prefix increment operator (`++x`) directly affects how the variables `x` and `y` are updated. Here's a detailed explanation of the code execution:

1. **`let x = 5;`** - The variable `x` is initialized with the value `5`.

2. **`let y = ++x;`** - The prefix increment operator (`++`) is used here. This operator increments the value of `x` by `1` before the assignment is made to `y`. So `x` is first incremented from `5` to `6`, and then this new value (`6`) is assigned to `y`.

3. **`console.log(y);`** - This prints the value of `y`, which received the incremented value of `x`, so it prints `6`.

4. **`console.log(x);`** - This prints the value of `x`, which has been incremented to `6`.

Thus, the output of your code will be:
```
6
6
```
