console.log(y); 



/*  


In JavaScript, the `!!` operator is used to explicitly convert a value to its boolean equivalent. It essentially converts any truthy value to `true` and any falsy value to `false`.

Let's break down the expression `!!x && !!!x`:

1. `!!x`: This converts the value of `x` to its boolean equivalent.
   - Since `x` is `7`, which is a truthy value, `!!x` evaluates to `true`.

2. `!!!x`: This applies the `!!` operator twice to `x`, effectively converting it to its boolean equivalent twice.
   - Since `x` is `7`, `!!x` evaluates to `true`.
   - Applying `!!` again to `true` results in `false`.

3. `true && false`: This is a logical AND operation. It returns `true` if both operands are `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.
   - In this case, one operand is `true` and the other is `false`, so the result is `false`.

Therefore, `y` will be `false`. When you log `y` to the console, it will output `false`.
