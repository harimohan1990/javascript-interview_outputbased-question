let x = "b"; 
let y = "a"; 

console.log(x + y + + y + y); 


/*   

Let's break down the expression `x + y + +y + y` step by step:

1. `x + y`: 
   - `x` is the string `"b"`.
   - `y` is the string `"a"`.
   - `x + y` concatenates the strings `"b"` and `"a"`, resulting in `"ba"`.

2. `+y`: 
   - The `+` operator before `y` attempts to convert `y` to a number.
   - Since `y` is the string `"a"`, it cannot be directly converted to a number, so it returns `NaN` (Not-a-Number).

3. `+ +y`: 
   - The `+` operator before `+y` is attempting to convert the `NaN` value to a number.
   - In JavaScript, applying the unary plus operator (`+`) to `NaN` results in `NaN`.

So, the final expression becomes `"ba" + NaN + y`, which concatenates `"ba"` with `"NaN"` (the string representation of `NaN`), resulting in `"baNaNy"`. 

Therefore, `console.log(x + y + +y + y);` will output `"baNaNy"`.
