let x = 10; 
let y = typeof (x == 10); 
  
console.log(y); 

//output 

"boolean"

/*
explanation : 

"boolean"
The code snippet initializes a variable `x` with the value `10`, then checks if `x` is equal to `10` using the equality operator (`==`). The result of this comparison is `true`. Then, the `typeof` operator is applied to this result, giving the type of the result, which is a boolean.

So, the output of the code will be:

```
"boolean"
```

This is because the result of the expression `(x == 10)` is a boolean (`true`), and `typeof` applied to a boolean value returns `"boolean"`.
