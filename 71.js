const array = [8, 18, 28, 38];
const result = array.map(element => element + 2)
               .filter((element) => element > 25);
console.log(result);


/*                
The code snippet you provided uses the `map` and `filter` methods of an array in JavaScript to transform and filter the elements of the array based on certain conditions. Let's break down what each method does in your code:

1. **`.map(element => element + 2)`** - This part of the code iterates over each element of the `array` and adds `2` to each element. The original array is `[8, 18, 28, 38]`. After applying the `map` function, the array becomes `[10, 20, 30, 40]`.

2. **`.filter((element) => element > 25)`** - This method filters the new array produced by the `map` function. It includes only those elements that are greater than `25`. From the array `[10, 20, 30, 40]`, the elements `30` and `40` satisfy this condition.

Therefore, after chaining these two methods, the `result` variable holds the array `[30, 40]`.

Thus, the output of your code will be:
```javascript
[30, 40]
```
